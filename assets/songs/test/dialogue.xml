		VS Nafrox happens 15 years after the events of FNF
BF and GF decide to have a last rap battle before- wait, what is that?
Nafrox, which is now a powerful hacker, decides to delete FNF to stop making songs easier. "No but really, the songs are now only 1 note and then it's the end. Let's bring back the old hard version of things, shall we? No? Well I see 1 other thing left."
Nafrox first tries to delete GF but kills her instead because of her demon powers preventing the deletetion.
Then, he goes to the main protagonist, BF. "What happened to him? Tf happened to his hat? Anyways, let's end this.
Nafrox succeds just to come back to the real world and GUESS WHO WAS WAITING FOR HIM.
I think you know who it is... No? UHFRIDO-
Anyways, Fridox tries to undo the deletetion but fails and die- why is nothing moving? Oh, since Fridox is the main character and the mod's creator, he can't die. (Yknow, plot armor.)
And since he acquired god powers, he rewinds time to 15 years in the past... 2021.
After "some" fights, he meets Nafrox before he acquired hacker powers.
Anyways, Fridox kills Nafrox and goes back to 2036 with a peaceful ending. Wow, that was long.
